# Cloud Pak LifeCycle Operator - cpeir project - TO DO list

The following are pending tasks in the development:

- Running `df -k` in openshift-image-registry registry pod (keep on hung)
- Evaluating storage capacity (how? pretend to allocate a pvc and check?)
- Creating pre-req check for installed software (exists or not exists - does checking helm chart enough? or specific services on namespaces?)
